        What’s your story? This question is the premise of Humans of Westview High School, a platform celebrating the vastly different experiences of students. While interviewing countless students and teachers, I transcribe their childhood, passion, struggles, and humor into words for the rest of the school to read and experience vicariously. 
        A few paragraphs are far from enough to express the extent of the individual but enough to get a glimpse at one’s world view. As others read the stories and are able to empathize with one of different circumstances, we are brought closer together as a class; the recount of a student who transferred from Dubai during her senior year helped those who have never moved schools understand the difficulties of adjusting to a new culture.<br/> 
        The photographs of students of a variety of nationalities, political views, and interests all taken against the background of the school buildings emphasize the vibrancy of diversity against the familiar campus. I am left in awe after every interview revealing a student’s passion for acting, composing, and mountain biking, with an even greater appreciation for the accepting community that allows for the pursuit of one’s ambitions. 
        My worldview encompasses not only those who I am similar to but those with different motivations, and remind me that I do not need to go far to be inspired by a fresh perspective. I welcome the unknown — the varying perspectives to understand and challenges I will inevitably face. 
        To this I will bring a determined and purposeful attitude that will not only propel me but will energize my peers with the same level of passion and grit.<br/>
        I contribute my commitment to exposing and bringing diverse groups together, being more aware of those with different circumstances, with the perspective that every person has a story worth listening to and learning from. While HoWV reveals distinct personas, I also hope that many find comfort in the universality of many struggles, with the message: You are not alone.
        Many of these experiences, such as with mental health, stereotypes, parents’ divorce, and the fear of not fitting in are often untouched, and relating these stories for peers leaves one vulnerable, requiring great courage. I am filled with respect at the strength to reveal one’s true, undisguised self that will inevitably fill another with hope. 
        <br/>These introductions of the students are not newspaper articles or interviews of their brightest accomplishments; they are short snippets of the individual in their honest, imperfect form. Being part of Humans of Westview fosters my pride and inspiration for my school’s many role models, also causing me to reflect on my previously limited perspective of the world.
        The interviews put the colors and voices of students into a few black and white words on a screen, but this process helps us connect and become more aware of who we are around every day.
