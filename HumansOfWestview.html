    "As a freshman, my most memorable experience on the varsity tennis team was being captain for many of our regular season games.Although I wasn't able to play for some time due to a torn growth plate, I was able to contribute to the team by providing useful coaching and moral support to the players. 
     It was amazing to see how my advice was abele to help some of the players win their matches and I felt proud of myself for playing a valuable role in the team despite being unable to compete. Fortunately, I was able to play in CIFs towards the end of the seasonand help our team readh the semifinals of our division. 
     I plan to continue as a leader on the tennis team by volunteering as captain during games as I did last season and providing crucial moral and strategic support to my teammates. I will also strive to be a good role model for my teammates by working hard and showing good character on and off the court"

     "[Mental Health Awareness Week - Day 1] I think that the school or country is never doing enough to raise awareness for those struggling with mental health. However, I do believe that improvements are constantly being made, and that we are on the right track. Support and acceptance for mental health has increased greatly over the years.
     Whether it be a Mental Health school-wide event with guest speakers or simply starting the conversation with awareness of the issue, change is happening. What exactly this change looks like, and how the school or country goes about properly implementing this change is the tricky part. It is crucial to not just simply say that they are addressing the issue,
     but to actually implement programs that effectively help those struggling with mental health. Mental Health week is one way that we as a school are starting to address the issue, but improements can always be made. I believe that nothing is one-hundred percent perfect yet, but I think that this week is a step in the right direction."

        What’s your story? This question is the premise of Humans of Westview High School, a platform celebrating the vastly different experiences of students. While interviewing countless students and teachers, I transcribe their childhood, passion, struggles, and humor into words for the rest of the school to read and experience vicariously. 
        A few paragraphs are far from enough to express the extent of the individual but enough to get a glimpse at one’s world view. As others read the stories and are able to empathize with one of different circumstances, we are brought closer together as a class; the recount of a student who transferred from Dubai during her senior year helped those who have never moved schools understand the difficulties of adjusting to a new culture.<br/> 
        The photographs of students of a variety of nationalities, political views, and interests all taken against the background of the school buildings emphasize the vibrancy of diversity against the familiar campus. I am left in awe after every interview revealing a student’s passion for acting, composing, and mountain biking, with an even greater appreciation for the accepting community that allows for the pursuit of one’s ambitions. 
        My worldview encompasses not only those who I am similar to but those with different motivations, and remind me that I do not need to go far to be inspired by a fresh perspective. I welcome the unknown — the varying perspectives to understand and challenges I will inevitably face. 
        To this I will bring a determined and purposeful attitude that will not only propel me but will energize my peers with the same level of passion and grit.<br/>
        I contribute my commitment to exposing and bringing diverse groups together, being more aware of those with different circumstances, with the perspective that every person has a story worth listening to and learning from. While HoWV reveals distinct personas, I also hope that many find comfort in the universality of many struggles, with the message: You are not alone.
        Many of these experiences, such as with mental health, stereotypes, parents’ divorce, and the fear of not fitting in are often untouched, and relating these stories for peers leaves one vulnerable, requiring great courage. I am filled with respect at the strength to reveal one’s true, undisguised self that will inevitably fill another with hope. 
        <br/>These introductions of the students are not newspaper articles or interviews of their brightest accomplishments; they are short snippets of the individual in their honest, imperfect form. Being part of Humans of Westview fosters my pride and inspiration for my school’s many role models, also causing me to reflect on my previously limited perspective of the world.
        The interviews put the colors and voices of students into a few black and white words on a screen, but this process helps us connect and become more aware of who we are around every day.
